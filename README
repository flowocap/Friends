  Installation
  ------------

        Friends uses Python's distutils framework for instalation. In
        order to install Friends, you will need to perform the
        following command as root:

      # make install

  Run Friends
  -----------

        Once Friends is installed, you can launch it with the command
        friends-service. Once it is running, it will access Ubuntu
        Online Accounts for all your microblogging-enabled accounts,
        and then retrieve all the public messages present on those
        accounts. Those messages can then be accessed over DBus, using
        a Dee.SharedModel.

  Testing
  -------

        You can run most of the test suite with the command `make
        check'. This will not include any dbus-enabled tests, which
        you can run with the command `make check_all'.

        You can do some microblogging from the commandline with this
        command:

        $ ./tools/debug_live.py twitter send 'Hello, World!'
